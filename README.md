The aim of Panchang Intelligence is to combine time-bound ancient Panchangam knowledge with latest technology, to help our farmers to predict rainfall.

## Short description

###The objectives of this project consist of:

1.To be able to predict weather accurately using different traditional methods like the Traditional Panchangam, and many more. 

2.To increase the accuracy of weather prediction using ancient techniques. 

3.To compare various almanacs and use a combination of different ancient techniques to accurately predict the weather conditions.

### What's the problem?

**IMD** :\
provides predictions which sometimes are not timely and accurate (70% typically)\
**Panchang** :\
Provides predictions in advance, accuracy between 7 to 87%, average 75% as per another study.\
Generalised across large areas.\
**Farm based prediction** :\
System which is local to the farm and based on observations.\
Very critical observations so needs expertise.

### What is Panchang?

●A Panchang is a Hindu calendar and almanac, which follows traditional units of Hindu timekeeping, and presents important dates and their calculations in a tabulated form.

●The casting of a Panchang involves elaborate mathematical work involving high level of spherical geometry and sound understanding of astronomical phenomena, such as sidereal movements of heavenly bodies. 

●However, in practice the tabulation is done on the basis of short-cut formulations as propounded by ancient Vedic sages and scholars.

●A typical Panchang may state tabulations of positions of Sun, Moon, and other planets for every day of the year on a fixed place (longitude, latitude) and time of day (in 24-hour format IST). The users calculate the remaining data using their relative difference from this fixed place and time.



### Results

●Accuracies:

●Traditional Panchang: 81%

●We have used data for 7 Indian locations i.e. Pune, Chandigarh, Guwahati, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chhattisgarh.

●40 years worth of daily rainfall data was used to verify our results

## Project roadmap

- Prediction of Temperature,  Relative Humidity, Pressure, Wind speed and direction using revalidated data.
- APIs to be consumed by startups, other institutions from various domains with appropriate subscription-based monetization.
