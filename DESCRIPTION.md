# Panchang Intelligence - Ancient Weather Forecast with Modern AI


The aim of Panchang Intelligence is to combine time-bound ancient Panchangam knowledge with latest technology, to help our farmers to predict rainfall.


## Scope

It has been an age old science in India to predict various results based on the Panchang and Planetary positions. Especially the rainfall/precipitation related predictions have been followed in the Indian agriculture practices for many years. 
As weather prediction science has progressed, it is still difficult to get very accurate predictions about weather for a longer duration like a farming season or a year. So, as our research we have generated Invaluable meteorological about “Rainfall Predictions”.



#### Objective

The objectives of this project consist of:

1.To be able to predict weather accurately using different traditional methods like the Traditional Panchangam, and many more. 

2.To increase the accuracy of weather prediction using ancient techniques. 

3.To compare various almanacs and use a combination of different ancient techniques to accurately predict the weather conditions. 

#### Motivation

●The IMD(Indian Meteorological Department) has been getting an acceptable accuracy for the prediction of seasonal rainfall, however when it comes to the off-seasonal rainfall, it is not that great.

●As against this, the traditional methods have a good accuracy in the prediction of such off-seasonal rainfall.

●So this was our motivation in using the ancient almanacs with the modern technique to accurately predict the rainfall throughout the year. 


## Conclusion

●Thus we have been able to use Panchang methods to forecast weather for 7 Indian locations with varying degrees of success.



●Our results prove that Panchang techniques can be utilised to provide a secondary opinion to the results obtained by scientific methods.



●Using an amalgamation of both, the ancient wisdom and modern techniques will provide us with a much better forecast scenario than the current systems.
### Results

Accuracies:

●Traditional Panchang: 81%

●We have used data for 7 Indian locations i.e. Pune, Chandigarh, Guwahati, Chennai, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chhattisgarh.

●40 years worth of daily rainfall data was used to verify our results
